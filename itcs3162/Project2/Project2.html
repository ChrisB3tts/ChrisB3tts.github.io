            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                Can the genre of music be determined by the quilities if the sound?
            </p>
            <p>
                The project uses the qualities of the sound to determine the genre of music.
                I aim to create a classification model that can determine the genre of music based on these qualities.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="data-source">
            <h2>Data Source</h2>
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/solomonameh/spotify-music-dataset">Spotify Music Dataset</a>
            <p>
                The dataset is a compilation of songs that are in Spotify playlists. 
                It includes the qualities of the sound such as tempo, danceability, valence, and loudness.
                It also inlcudes a lof of data about the song such as genre, artist, track popularity, and duration as well as more technical information such as track id, uri, and api stuff.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Data Pre-processing</h2>
            <p>
                For the data preprocessing, I removed all the columns that were not required for the model. This includes data that identifies the song on spotify such as href, id, uri, etc.
                I removed the very few null entries in the dataset.
            </p>
            <p>
                The columns that I kept are:
                <ul style="text-align: left; display: inline-block;">
                <h3>Music Qualities include:</h3>
                <li>Time Signature</li>
                <li>Spechiness</li>
                <li>Danceability</li>
                <li>Energy</li>
                <li>Valence</li>
                <li>Key</li>
                <li>Tempo</li>
                <li>Loudness</li>
                <li>Acousticness</li>
                <li>Liveness</li>
                <li>Track Popularity</li>
                <li>Duration</li>


            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Visualizations</h2>
            <h3>Genre Count</h3>
            <img src="output.png" alt="Count of each Genre">
            <p>
                This chart show the distribution of genres in the dataset. Electronic music is the most popular 
                genre followed by ambient, lofi, latin, and world. 
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>Model</h2>
            <p>
                I created a classification model using the following algorithms:
                <ul>
                    <li>Decision Tree</li>
                    <li>Random Forest</li>
                    <li>K Nearest Neighbors</li>
                </ul>
                The model that performs the best was Random Forest with an accuracy ranging from 48.5% to 50.5%.
                It has a precison score ranging from 0.29 to 0.32, a recall score ranging from 0.35 to 0.50, and an f1 score ranging from 0.32 to 0.36.
                Due to there being a large amount of catagories, the model was not able to perform well. If the genre separation was more gernalized, the model would have performed better.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p> 
                This project shows that there is a correlation between the qualities of the sound and the genre of music. Though in these circumstances, the model was not able to perform well, in a real world setting, the model could be used to determine the genre of music based on the qualities of the sound.

                This project has taught me more about classification models and the how to understand the metrics of a classification models.
