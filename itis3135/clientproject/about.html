            <p>
                Hey there, I’m Christine Betts, a nature and wildlife photographer based in North Carolina, always
                chasing
                light,
                quiet moments, and the wild things in between. I spend a lot of time exploring the Blue Ridge Mountains,
                walking the shores of the Outer Banks, and watching reflections shift on peaceful lakes. Whether it's a
                horse moving
                through the dunes on the coast or a heron lifting off from still water, I love capturing those
                unscripted
                moments in the natural world.
            </p>
            <p>
                For me, photography is about more than just beautiful views — it’s about the feeling of being out there.
                The
                hush of the woods, the rhythm of waves, the stillness before a bird takes flight. North Carolina is full
                of
                these little wonders, and I try to reflect that through every image I make.
