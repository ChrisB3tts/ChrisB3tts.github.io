    <p> file and folder names are good, not capitals or spaces.</p>
    <p> The pages use good contrasting colors. I wish the green was used in other places, it works nice.</p>
    <p> I wish the book images were a little larger</p>
    <p> The about us page is very dense and somewhat hard to read</p>
    <p> I like the the book overviews are done, but for some reason to me it feels a little off</p>
    <p> over all good website</p>
